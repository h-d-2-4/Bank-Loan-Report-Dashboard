# 🏦 Bank Loan Report Dashboard (Excel)

This project features an Excel-based interactive dashboard built from a structured dataset of 38,576 bank loan applications. The goal is to provide meaningful visual insights into loan approval behavior, applicant profiles, and key financial metrics.

## 📊 Dashboard Metrics

- ✅ **Total Loan Applications**: 38,576
- 💰 **Total Funded Amount**: $435,757,075+
- 💸 **Total Amount Received**: $473,070,933+
- 📈 **Avg. Interest Rate**: 12.05%
- 🧾 **Avg. Debt-to-Income (DTI)**: 13.33%

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Most approved loans fall in **Grade B & C** with a **36-month term**.
- High income doesn't always ensure loan approval—**employment verification** and credit history play a significant role.
- **California, New York, and Texas** account for the highest number of loan applicants.
- Loans with lower **DTI** and robust **credit histories** are more likely to perform better.
